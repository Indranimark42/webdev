    <section><h1>EARLY NOTIONS</h1></section>
    <li>
      The idea of an object with gravity so strong that not even light could
      escape it can be traced back to the 18th century. Philosopher and
      naturalist John Michell is often credited with proposing the idea of "dark
      stars" in 1783. However, this was more of a theoretical concept at the
      time.

    <section><h1>Einstein's Theory of General Relativity</h1></section>
    <li>
      Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, published in 1915,
      revolutionized our understanding of gravity. It described gravity as the
      warping of spacetime by massive objects. While Einstein's equations
      allowed for the existence of objects with extremely strong gravitational
      fields, he did not fully grasp the concept of black holes initially.
    </li>
    <section><h1>Schwarzschild Solution (1916):</h1></section>
    <li>
      Karl Schwarzschild, a German physicist, was one of the first to find a
      solution to Einstein's equations that described a non-rotating,
      spherically symmetric black hole. This solution became known as the
      Schwarzschild metric.
    </li>
    <section><h1>Black Hole Terminology (1960s):</h1></section>
    <li>
      The term "black hole" was coined by physicist John Archibald Wheeler in
      the 1960s. Prior to this, such objects were often referred to as "frozen
      stars" or "collapsars."
    </li>
    <section><h1>Hawking Radiation (1974):</h1></section>
    <li>
      In 1974, British physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes are
      not completely "black." He theorized that due to quantum effects near the
      event horizon, black holes can emit tiny particles and radiation, which
      came to be known as "Hawking radiation." This groundbreaking discovery
      suggested that black holes could slowly evaporate over time.
    </li>
    <section><h1>Observational Evidence (20th Century - Present):</h1></section>
    <li>
      The first indirect evidence of black holes came from the observation of
      binary star systems, where one component was invisible but had a strong
      gravitational effect on its visible companion. Astronomers later
      discovered supermassive black holes at the centers of many galaxies. The
      Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project captured the first direct image of
      the event horizon of a black hole in the center of the galaxy M87 in 2019.
    </li>
    <section><h1>Continued Research and Mysteries:</h1></section>
    <li>
      Black holes remain a subject of intense scientific study and fascination.
      They challenge our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics,
      especially the interplay between general relativity and quantum mechanics.
      Researchers are also investigating the possibility of using black holes as
      tools for exploring aspects of these theories.
